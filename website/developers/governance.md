# `gofannon` Governance Overview

`gofannon` is an AI Alliance Project. The governance model of the AI Alliance 
(AIA) is a work in progress. As the AI Alliance matures, we expect changes and 
refinements in process and structure. The current `gofannon` governance model is
inspired by the [Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Governance](https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/), 
because 1) it is a feature complete governance model and 2) all co-leads of 
`gofannon` are ASF members.

We operate under a mutual handshake agreement to follow ASF rules **except** in the cases where:
1. They conflict with the practices outlined in the [AI Alliance Governance](https://thealliance.ai/governance), or
2. Specific exceptions have been explicitly stated (see below).

## Key Differences from ASF Governance

| ASF                          | AIA                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Releases require vote**   | 🚫 Releases do **not** require a vote     |
| **Mailing lists required**  | 💬 Use **GitHub Discussions** instead     |
| **private@ mailing list**   | 🧟‍♂️ Use invite only Slack channel | 
| **Releases must be mirrored on ASF infra** | ✅ Releases and git do **not** need to be mirrored on owned servers |
| **Uses ICLA (Contributor License Agreement)** | 🔏 AIA uses **DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)** |
| **PMC (Project Management Committee)** | 👥 AIA uses **Co-leads** as project leads |
| **Committers**              | 🧑‍💻 AIA refers to these as **Core Contributors** |
