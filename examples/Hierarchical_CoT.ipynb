            "\n",
            "Quantum Entanglement is a fundamental concept in Quantum Mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when they are separated by large distances. This means that measuring the state of one particle instantly affects the state of the other entangled particles. Entanglement is a key feature of quantum systems and is used as a resource in quantum computing and quantum information processing. It allows for the creation of a shared quantum state between particles, enabling quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and quantum cryptography. Entanglement is characterized by the inability to factor the wave function of the system into a product of separate wave functions for each particle, indicating a non-classical correlation between the particles.\n",

            "\n",
            "Quantum Measurement: In quantum mechanics, measurement is a fundamental concept that describes the interaction between a quantum system and a classical observer. When a measurement is made on a quantum system, its state collapses from a superposition of possible states to one of the possible outcomes. This collapse is known as wave function collapse. The measurement process is described by the measurement postulate, which states that the probability of obtaining a particular outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of that outcome in the system's wave function. There are two types of measurements: strong measurements, which cause the wave function to collapse, and weak measurements, which do not. Quantum measurement is a crucial aspect of quantum computing, as it allows us to extract information from quantum systems and perform computations.\n",

            "The Schrödinger Equation is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing the time-evolution of a quantum system. It's a partial differential equation that relates the wave function of a system to its energy. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by iℏ(∂ψ/∂t) = Hψ, where i is the imaginary unit, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, ψ is the wave function, t is time, and H is the Hamiltonian operator representing the total energy of the system. The time-independent Schrödinger equation, given by Hψ = Eψ, is used to find the allowed energy levels of a system, where E is the energy of the system. The Schrödinger Equation is crucial for understanding quantum systems, as it provides a mathematical framework for predicting the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, which is essential for quantum computing.\n",
